Toit큰 Te Whenua makes New Zealand's most up-to-date publicly owned coastal elevation data freely available to use under an open licence. You can access this through the [Registry of Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/nz-coastal/).

## Quickstart

## Background

This repository contains STAC Collection metadata for each coastal elevation dataset.

The New Zealand Elevation repository guidance documentation covers information that also applies to coastal elevation:

- [Naming](https://github.com/linz/elevation/blob/master/docs/naming.md) covers the bucket naming structure
- [Usage](https://github.com/linz/elevation/blob/master/docs/usage.md) shows how TIFFs can be interacted with from S3 using GDAL, QGIS, etc
- [Elevation Compression](https://github.com/linz/elevation/blob/master/docs/tiff-compression/README.md) provides commentary and analysis on the compression options we explored.

## AWS Access

Toit큰 Te Whenua owns and maintains a public bucket which is sponsored and shared via the [Registry of Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/nz-coastal/) `s3://nz-coastal` in `ap-southeast-2`.

Using the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) anyone can access all of the imagery specified in this repository.

```
aws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://nz-coastal/
```
